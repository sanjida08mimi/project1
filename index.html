    <h2> What is Artificial Intelligence? </h2>
    
  
    <p >Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned 
with building computers and machines that can reason, learn,
and act in such a way that would normally require human 
intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what
humans can analyze. </p>

    <h3>How does AI work?</h3>

    <p>
While the specifics vary across different AI techniques, 
the core principle revolves around data.
AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data,
identifying patterns and relationships that humans may miss.

This learning process often involves algorithms,
which are sets of rules or instructions that guide
the AI's analysis and decision-making. In machine learning,
a popular subset of AI, algorithms are trained on labeled 
or unlabeled data to make predictions or categorize information.

    <div class="src" title="Artificial Intelligence">Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions,
including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more. I am including some pictures
with description which represents AI or I can say defines AI .</div>

    <div class="src">Artificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve 
specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. </div>

Machine learning :
A simple way to think about AI is as a series of nested or derivative concepts that have emerged over more than 70 years.
